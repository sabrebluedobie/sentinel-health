Core Correlation Components:

1. Sleep-Migraine Correlation Analysis
Path: src/pages/Dashboard.jsx
- Processes sleep pattern relationships with migraine occurrence
- Time-lagged correlation analysis for predictive insights
- Multi-day pattern recognition for sleep quality impact
Importance Score: 90

2. Glucose Impact Analysis
Path: src/components/DetailedGlucoseChart.jsx
- Cross-correlates glucose levels with pain intensity
- Time-weighted glucose averaging against migraine events
- Threshold-based glucose event detection
Importance Score: 85

3. Weather Correlation Engine
Path: src/components/WeatherWidget.jsx
- Analyzes barometric pressure changes impact on migraines
- Environmental trigger correlation including:
  - Pressure delta calculations
  - Humidity impact assessment
  - Temperature variation effects
Importance Score: 75

4. Sleep Quality Scoring Algorithm
Path: src/pages/LogSleep-hybrid.jsx
- Deep sleep percentage analysis (15-25% ideal range)
- REM sleep percentage evaluation (20-25% ideal)
- Heart rate variability impact calculations
- SpO2 threshold quality adjustments
Importance Score: 80

Key Correlation Rules:
- Multi-factor pattern recognition across health metrics
- Time-lagged analysis for predictive correlations
- Environmental impact weighting system
- Sleep quality scoring based on medical standards
- Glucose variation impact assessment

The system's core value lies in its ability to identify complex relationships between multiple health factors and migraine occurrences, with particular emphasis on sleep patterns, glucose levels, and environmental conditions.
