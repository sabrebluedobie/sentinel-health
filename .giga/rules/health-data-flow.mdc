Key Data Flow Components:

1. CGM Data Pipeline (Importance Score: 95)
- Integration with multiple CGM sources (Nightscout, Dexcom) 
- Glucose reading normalization and standardization
- Time-series synchronization with unified processing
- Structured metadata handling for glucose events

2. Sleep Analysis Flow (Importance Score: 85)
- Multi-stage sleep data processing
- Integration of physiological metrics (HR, HRV, SpO2)
- Body battery recovery calculations
- Sleep stage quality scoring pipeline

3. Weather Data Integration (Importance Score: 75)
- Barometric pressure monitoring stream
- Humidity correlation processing
- Temperature fluctuation analysis
- Real-time weather condition merging with symptoms

4. Data Correlation Engine (Importance Score: 90)
- Time-series pattern detection between:
  - Blood glucose levels
  - Sleep metrics
  - Pain levels
  - Weather conditions
- Lag analysis for predictive correlations
- Multi-factor trigger analysis pipeline

Critical Data Flow Paths:
- CGM → Correlation Engine → Symptom Analysis
- Weather Data → Trigger Analysis → Pain Correlation
- Sleep Metrics → Recovery Analysis → Health Score

The system implements specialized health data synchronization with emphasis on temporal alignment and medical data integrity across multiple sources and processing pipelines.
