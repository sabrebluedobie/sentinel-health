## Core Data Processing Pipelines

1. CGM Data Pipeline (src/components/DetailedGlucoseChart.jsx)
Importance Score: 85
- Processes continuous glucose monitoring streams
- Integrates with multiple CGM data sources
- Implements time-weighted glucose averaging
- Handles threshold-based event detection
- Manages data synchronization with medical systems

2. Sleep Analysis Pipeline (src/pages/LogSleep-hybrid.jsx)
Importance Score: 90
- Processes raw sleep stage data
- Calculates deep sleep percentages (15-25% target)
- Analyzes REM sleep patterns (20-25% target)
- Evaluates heart rate variability impacts
- Monitors SpO2 thresholds for quality adjustments

3. Environmental Data Integration (src/components/WeatherWidget.jsx)
Importance Score: 75
- Tracks environmental health triggers
- Processes barometric pressure changes
- Monitors humidity level impacts
- Analyzes temperature fluctuations
- Correlates weather conditions with health events

## Data Flow Architecture

1. Medical Data Synchronization
- Bi-directional sync between CGM systems
- Integration of sleep tracking devices
- Weather data aggregation pipeline
- Cross-system health event correlation

2. Health Metric Processing
- Continuous glucose data stream processing
- Sleep stage analysis pipeline
- Environmental factor correlation engine
- Time-series health data aggregation
