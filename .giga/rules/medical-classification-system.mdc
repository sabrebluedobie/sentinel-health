# medical-classification-system

The headache classification system implements probabilistic medical categorization with the following core components:

1. Symptom-Based Classification
Path: src/components/HeadacheTypesChart.jsx
- Implements pattern matching against known headache profiles
- Symptom weight calculations for classification confidence
- Multi-factor severity assessment
Importance Score: 85

Key Classification Rules:
- Symptom mapping based on medical standards
- Severity weighting system for symptoms
- Pattern matching against established headache profiles
- Probabilistic type determination

2. Symptom Tracking Components:
Path: src/components/HeadacheTypesChart.jsx
- Structured recording of symptom characteristics
- Standardized severity scales
- Temporal tracking of symptom progression
Importance Score: 80

Classification Categories:
- Migraine with aura
- Migraine without aura
- Tension headache
- Cluster headache
- Other primary headaches

The system employs medical pattern recognition to categorize headache events based on:
- Symptom combinations
- Pain characteristics
- Associated symptoms
- Duration patterns
- Response to medications

Each classification includes:
- Probability scoring
- Confidence metrics
- Warning flag triggers
- Clinical correlation indicators
