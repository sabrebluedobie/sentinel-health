Importance Score: 85/100

Core Classification Components:

1. Headache Type Classification
- Structured categorization system based on:
  - Primary symptom patterns
  - Pain characteristics (throbbing, pressure, etc.)
  - Associated symptoms (nausea, aura, etc.)
  - Duration patterns
  - Trigger correlations

2. Symptom Mapping Engine
- Multi-dimensional symptom tracking
  - Location mapping (unilateral, bilateral)
  - Intensity scoring (1-10 scale)
  - Associated symptom groups
  - Progression patterns
- Symptom-based classification matching

3. Pattern Recognition System
- Temporal analysis of headache episodes
- Trigger correlation tracking:
  - Sleep patterns
  - Weather conditions
  - Glucose variations
  - Stress levels
- Pattern-based classification refinement

4. Classification Rules
- Hierarchical decision tree for headache type determination
- Primary classification categories:
  - Migraine (with/without aura)
  - Tension-type headaches
  - Cluster headaches
  - Secondary headaches
- Sub-classification based on:
  - Frequency patterns
  - Symptom combinations
  - Trigger associations

The system implements medical-grade headache classification following international headache society guidelines, with custom extensions for pattern recognition and trigger correlation analysis.

# medical-classification-system

The medical classification system implements specialized tracking and analysis for headache/migraine patterns with the following key components:

## Symptom Mapping System
- Comprehensive migraine symptom tracking with:
  * Intensity scaling (1-10)
  * Location mapping
  * Associated symptoms (nausea, aura, etc.)
  * Duration tracking
Importance Score: 85

## Weather Correlation Engine
Location: src/hooks/useMigraineCorrelations.js
- Advanced correlation system tracking:
  * Barometric pressure changes
  * Temperature fluctuations
  * Humidity levels
  * Pattern matching with migraine occurrences
Importance Score: 80

## Trigger Analysis System
Location: src/components/modals/MigraineLogModal.jsx
- Structured trigger categorization:
  * Environmental factors
  * Dietary triggers
  * Hormonal influences
  * Sleep pattern correlations
- Historical pattern recognition for trigger identification
Importance Score: 90

## Medication Effectiveness Tracking
- Tracks response to different medication types
- Records effectiveness duration
- Monitors side effects
- Calculates optimal timing for medication administration
Importance Score: 75

## Pattern Recognition Algorithm
- Identifies recurring migraine patterns based on:
  * Time of day
  * Day of week
  * Monthly cycles
  * Seasonal variations
- Generates predictive alerts for high-risk periods
Importance Score: 85

Overall System Importance Score: 85
