Importance Score: 85/100

Core Classification Components:

1. Headache Type Classification
- Structured categorization system based on:
  - Primary symptom patterns
  - Pain characteristics (throbbing, pressure, etc.)
  - Associated symptoms (nausea, aura, etc.)
  - Duration patterns
  - Trigger correlations

2. Symptom Mapping Engine
- Multi-dimensional symptom tracking
  - Location mapping (unilateral, bilateral)
  - Intensity scoring (1-10 scale)
  - Associated symptom groups
  - Progression patterns
- Symptom-based classification matching

3. Pattern Recognition System
- Temporal analysis of headache episodes
- Trigger correlation tracking:
  - Sleep patterns
  - Weather conditions
  - Glucose variations
  - Stress levels
- Pattern-based classification refinement

4. Classification Rules
- Hierarchical decision tree for headache type determination
- Primary classification categories:
  - Migraine (with/without aura)
  - Tension-type headaches
  - Cluster headaches
  - Secondary headaches
- Sub-classification based on:
  - Frequency patterns
  - Symptom combinations
  - Trigger associations

The system implements medical-grade headache classification following international headache society guidelines, with custom extensions for pattern recognition and trigger correlation analysis.

# medical-classification-system

The medical classification system implements a sophisticated headache/migraine diagnostic pattern matching system with several key components:

1. Diagnostic Pattern Matching (Importance Score: 95)
src/hooks/useHeadacheTypes.js
- Symptom-based probability calculation for classifying headache types:
  - Migraine with aura
  - Migraine without aura
  - Tension headache
  - Cluster headache
- Pattern recognition based on symptom combinations and severity
- Weighted scoring system for diagnostic confidence levels

2. Severity Assessment Engine (Importance Score: 90)
src/services/migraines.js
- Multi-factor severity calculation incorporating:
  - Pain intensity (1-10 scale)
  - Associated symptoms presence/severity
  - Duration of episode
  - Impact on daily activities
- Automated classification based on severity thresholds

3. Symptom Pattern Recognition (Importance Score: 85)
src/components/modals/MigraineLogModal.jsx
- Structured symptom mapping for classification
- Temporal relationship tracking between symptoms
- Recognition of aura patterns and progression
- Impact weighting based on symptom combinations

Core Classification Rules:
- Primary symptom combinations determine initial classification
- Secondary symptoms adjust classification confidence
- Severity thresholds influence final categorization
- Temporal patterns affect classification reliability
- Minimum symptom requirements for each headache type
