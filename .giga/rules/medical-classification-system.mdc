Importance Score: 85/100

Core Classification Components:

1. Headache Type Classification
- Structured categorization system based on:
  - Primary symptom patterns
  - Pain characteristics (throbbing, pressure, etc.)
  - Associated symptoms (nausea, aura, etc.)
  - Duration patterns
  - Trigger correlations

2. Symptom Mapping Engine
- Multi-dimensional symptom tracking
  - Location mapping (unilateral, bilateral)
  - Intensity scoring (1-10 scale)
  - Associated symptom groups
  - Progression patterns
- Symptom-based classification matching

3. Pattern Recognition System
- Temporal analysis of headache episodes
- Trigger correlation tracking:
  - Sleep patterns
  - Weather conditions
  - Glucose variations
  - Stress levels
- Pattern-based classification refinement

4. Classification Rules
- Hierarchical decision tree for headache type determination
- Primary classification categories:
  - Migraine (with/without aura)
  - Tension-type headaches
  - Cluster headaches
  - Secondary headaches
- Sub-classification based on:
  - Frequency patterns
  - Symptom combinations
  - Trigger associations

The system implements medical-grade headache classification following international headache society guidelines, with custom extensions for pattern recognition and trigger correlation analysis.

# medical-classification-system

The medical classification system implements structured categorization and analysis of headache conditions with the following key components:

HEADACHE CLASSIFICATION ENGINE
Path: src/data/migraineEducation.js
- Clinical categorization of migraine types with symptom mapping
- Structured classification of migraine presentations and associated risks
- Pattern matching for symptom combinations and trigger correlations
Importance Score: 95

SYMPTOM TRACKING & ANALYSIS
Path: src/pages/LogMigraine.jsx
- Voice-enabled symptom logging with medical terminology recognition
- Weather correlation analysis for migraine patterns
- Structured data model mapping symptoms to clinical classifications
Importance Score: 85

VISUALIZATION & REPORTING
Path: src/components/HeadacheTypesChart.jsx
- Clinical visualization of headache type distributions
- Pattern recognition for symptom frequency analysis
- Medical trend visualization with clinical relevance markers
Importance Score: 75

Core Classification Logic:
1. Symptom-based categorization of headache types
2. Pattern matching for trigger identification
3. Risk assessment based on symptom combinations
4. Weather condition correlation analysis
5. Clinical terminology mapping
