## Core Data Models
Importance Score: 95/100

### Health Metrics Models
1. Glucose Readings
- Blood glucose level measurements 
- Source tracking (Nightscout, Dexcom, manual)
- Reading type classification (SGV, MBG)
- Temporal metadata and device information

2. Sleep Records
- Sleep stage percentages (deep, REM, light)
- Physiological metrics (HR, HRV, SpO2)
- Recovery score calculations
- Sleep quality indicators

3. Migraine Events
- Pain levels and intensity tracking
- Associated symptoms catalog
- Trigger correlations
- Weather condition linkage

## Relationships & Correlations
Importance Score: 90/100

1. Glucose-Migraine Correlation
- Bidirectional relationship tracking
- Time-lagged pattern analysis
- Threshold breach impacts
- Multi-point correlation scoring

2. Sleep-Migraine Dependencies
- Sleep quality impact tracking
- Recovery score influence
- Stage distribution effects
- Temporal onset patterns

3. Weather-Health Relationships
- Barometric pressure connections
- Humidity impact tracking
- Temperature variation effects

## External System Integration
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Nightscout Integration
- Glucose data normalization
- Event type mapping
- Metadata transformation
- Bidirectional sync patterns

2. Dexcom Integration
