## Core Data Models
Importance Score: 95/100

### Health Metrics Models
1. Glucose Readings
- Blood glucose level measurements 
- Source tracking (Nightscout, Dexcom, manual)
- Reading type classification (SGV, MBG)
- Temporal metadata and device information

2. Sleep Records
- Sleep stage percentages (deep, REM, light)
- Physiological metrics (HR, HRV, SpO2)
- Recovery score calculations
- Sleep quality indicators

3. Migraine Events
- Pain levels and intensity tracking
- Associated symptoms catalog
- Trigger correlations
- Weather condition linkage

## Relationships & Correlations
Importance Score: 90/100

1. Glucose-Migraine Correlation
- Bidirectional relationship tracking
- Time-lagged pattern analysis
- Threshold breach impacts
- Multi-point correlation scoring

2. Sleep-Migraine Dependencies
- Sleep quality impact tracking
- Recovery score influence
- Stage distribution effects
- Temporal onset patterns

3. Weather-Health Relationships
- Barometric pressure connections
- Humidity impact tracking
- Temperature variation effects

## External System Integration
Importance Score: 85/100

1. Nightscout Integration
- Glucose data normalization
- Event type mapping
- Metadata transformation
- Bidirectional sync patterns

2. Dexcom Integration
- Reading classification
- Trend analysis structures
- Device data mapping
- OAuth data flow models

# data-models-relationships

## Core Health Data Models

1. MIGRAINE EPISODES
- Structured model for tracking migraine occurrences
- Attributes: pain levels, triggers, medications, effectiveness
- Weather correlation data points
- Clinical symptom categorization
Importance Score: 85

2. SLEEP METRICS
- Deep sleep percentage tracking (15-25% ideal range)
- REM sleep monitoring (20-25% ideal range)
- Body battery recovery calculations
- Physiological rest indicators (heart rate, HRV, SpO2)
Importance Score: 80

3. GLUCOSE READINGS
- Integration with Nightscout and Dexcom systems
- Time-in-range calculations
- Normalized glucose data format
- Sync state tracking per user
Importance Score: 90

## Data Relationships

HEALTH METRIC CORRELATIONS
- Sleep quality impact on migraine frequency
- Weather condition relationships to migraine triggers
- Glucose level effects on sleep patterns
- Medication timing optimization based on body metrics
Importance Score: 85

EXTERNAL SYSTEM INTEGRATION
- Bidirectional Nightscout data sync
- Dexcom EGV format transformation
- CGM data normalization
- Cross-system deduplication
Importance Score: 90

## Data Storage Patterns

CLIENT-SIDE HEALTH DATA
- Namespaced storage with "sentinel:" prefix
- Domain-specific timestamp sorting
- Medical data filtering with range support
- Health metric isolation patterns
Importance Score: 75
